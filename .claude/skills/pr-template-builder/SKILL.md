# PR Template Builder

Create standardized GitHub templates for pull requests, issues, and discussions to streamline collaboration.

## Core Workflow

1. **Identify template needs**: PR, issues, discussions
2. **Create .github directory**: Standard location for templates
3. **Design PR template**: Checklist, sections, guidance
4. **Create issue templates**: Bug reports, feature requests
5. **Add config.yml**: Control issue/PR creation flow
6. **Test templates**: Verify rendering on GitHub

## Directory Structure

```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep templates focused**: One purpose per template
2. **Use YAML forms**: Better UX than markdown for issues
3. **Add helpful descriptions**: Guide users through fields
4. **Make fields required strategically**: Balance info vs friction
5. **Include checklists**: Ensure completeness
6. **Link to documentation**: Help users find answers
7. **Disable blank issues**: Force template usage
8. **Add CODEOWNERS**: Automate review assignment
9. **Test on GitHub**: Verify rendering and validation
